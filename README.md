# Description of the project

Minty is a website that demonstrates the Minty algorithm. Minty's algorithm is a method for finding the shortest paths from a source to each vertex in a network.

## Task received

- develop a program that implements Minty's algorithm and check its operation;
- develop a page (site) for popularization and distribution of the developed product on the Internet.

## Functionality

**Home page**
On the main page of the site, we present our developers and the possibility of switching to other sections of the site.

**Minty Algorithm**
On this work page, we display Minty's rendering algorithm. The user can enter input data and watch the algorithm work in real time.

**About**
Information about university, department, supervior, year and contributors

## Technologies

   TS + Angular

## Usage:

1. After pressing the Seed button, fill in the prepared data. If you wish, you can fill in your own.

Let's get a graph.![image-1](https://github.com/dikapt/task1/assets/120253697/e1c411b7-12c1-4052-9a49-d063f7b0db9a)

2. By clicking on any vertex, the algorithm will start looking for the shortest path and see it in green. The right will write the distance ("H: 16" in the screenshot). If the path is not found, display a message.
3. Also added a function to save entered data to the browser's local storage.

   Now we can select the dataset we need from the list.
