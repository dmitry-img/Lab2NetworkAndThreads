# Minty

This project is built with Angular version 16.1.6. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- npm (version 6.x or later)

Check your versions by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Install Angular CLI

Install Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@16.1.6
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

In the project directory, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Serve the Application

Start the application locally:

```bash
ng serve
```

Access your app at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Further Help

For more on Angular CLI, use `ng help` or visit the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).


# Description of the project

Minty is a website that demonstrates the Minty algorithm. Minty's algorithm is a method for finding the shortest paths from a source to each vertex in a network.

## Task received

- develop a program that implements Minty's algorithm and check its operation;
- develop a page (site) for popularization and distribution of the developed product on the Internet.

## Functionality

**Home page**
On the main page of the site, we present our developers and the possibility of switching to other sections of the site.

**Minty Algorithm**
On this work page, we display Minty's rendering algorithm. The user can enter input data and watch the algorithm work in real time.

**About**
Information about university, department, supervior, year and contributors

## Technologies

   TS + Angular

## Usage:

1. By choosing Saved Datasets, the collected data will be filled. If you wish, you can fill in your own.![img1](https://github.com/dikapt/task1/assets/120253697/8e39f64f-d072-4098-8ad2-fec28064738d)We get the graph.![img2](https://github.com/dikapt/task1/assets/120253697/402edfe0-6ca1-405c-bac0-cf754d3ca8fd)
2. By clicking on any node, the algorithm will start looking for the shortest path, and highlight it in green. The right will write the distance ("H: 16" in the screenshot). It also shows every step of getting to the choosed node.
   If the path is not found, a message will be displayed.![img3](https://github.com/dikapt/task1/assets/120253697/ac15bbac-8953-427f-aefc-b320ec6c6c6f)
3. Also added a function to save the entered data to the browser's local storage.

   Now we can choose the dataset we need from the list.
